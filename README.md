# Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project

## Project Overview

The Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project aimed to establish a robust infrastructure for disease surveillance within the MTU College of Computing Cluster. The project focused on creating a system that allows for the creation, deployment, and management of virtual machines (VMs) for various healthcare institutions. These VMs were configured to facilitate the installation of essential healthcare software, including OpenEMR and HAPI FHIR servers, for the purpose of data exchange, analytics, and public health decision-making.

## Objectives

1. **Infrastructure Setup:** Establish a virtualized environment within the MTU College of Computing Cluster to host healthcare-related VMs.
2. **Software Deployment:** Deploy necessary healthcare software, including OpenEMR and HAPI FHIR servers, on the VMs.
3. **Configuration:** Configure the VMs to ensure proper networking, security, and compatibility with the deployed software.
4. **Interoperability Testing:** Verify the interoperability of the deployed systems for seamless data exchange.
5. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation and training materials for users to effectively utilize the deployed infrastructure.

## Technologies Used

- **VMware vSphere:** Used for virtualization and management of VMs within the MTU College of Computing Cluster.
- **OpenEMR:** Open-source electronic medical records and medical practice management solution.
- **HAPI FHIR Server:** Implementation of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for data exchange in healthcare.
- **Docker:** Containerization platform used for deploying and managing software applications.
- **Postman:** API development and testing tool used for interacting with the HAPI FHIR RESTful client.
- **Synthea:** Open-source synthetic patient data generator for healthcare simulation and testing purposes.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Complex Configuration:** Configuring the networking and security settings for the VMs required careful attention to detail.
2. **Software Integration:** Ensuring seamless integration between different healthcare software components posed challenges during deployment.
3. **Interoperability Testing:** Verifying the interoperability of the deployed systems required thorough testing and troubleshooting.
4. **Documentation:** Creating comprehensive documentation for users with varying levels of technical expertise was time-consuming.

## Outcomes Achieved

1. **Established Infrastructure:** Successfully set up a virtualized environment within the MTU College of Computing Cluster for hosting healthcare-related VMs.
2. **Deployed Healthcare Software:** Successfully deployed OpenEMR and HAPI FHIR servers on the VMs for data management and exchange.
3. **Configured Networking:** Configured networking settings to ensure proper communication between VMs and external systems.
4. **Interoperability Verified:** Verified the interoperability of deployed systems, enabling seamless data exchange and analytics.
5. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provided detailed documentation and training materials to enable users to effectively utilize the deployed infrastructure for public health surveillance and decision-making.
